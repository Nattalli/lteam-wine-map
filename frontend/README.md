# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installing

1. First, make sure you have Node.js LTS version(18.14.2 for now) installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Node.js website https://nodejs.org/en/.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command to install Create React App globally:
`npm install -g create-react-app`
3. Once the installation is complete, navigate to the frontend directory and run:
`npm install`

That's it! You now have all required tools to run React application created using the Create React App tool.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
